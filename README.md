# Predict daily rainfall in Australia

As the course requirement for the course DSCI525 Web and Cloud Computing, we aim to build and deploy an ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a dataset of size around 6 GB, containing modelled and observed daily rainfall data over NSW, Australia, spanning 1889 - 2014. The features are outputs of different climate models, and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

## Data

The dataset was created by Tomas Beuzen, available on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681).
