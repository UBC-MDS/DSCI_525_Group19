    "***Milestone 3:*** This milestone aims to set up your spark cluster and develop your machine learning to deploy in the cloud for the next milestone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone 3 checklist  :\n",
    "- [x] Setup your EMR cluster with Spark, Hadoop, JupyterEnterpriseGateway, JupyterHub 1.1.0, and Livy.  \n",
    "- [x] Make sure you set up foxy proxy for your web browser(Firefox). Probably you already set this up from the previous milestone.\n",
    "- [x] Develop a ML model using scikit-learn. (We will be using this model to deploy for our next milestone.)\n",
    "- [x] Obtain the best hyperparameter settings using spark's MLlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep in mind:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Please use the Firefox browser for this milestone. Make sure you got foxy proxy setup._\n",
    "\n",
    "- _All services you use are in region us-west-2 region._\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Use only default VPC and subnet, if not specified explicitly in instruction, leave all other options default when setting up your cluster._\n",
    "    \n",
    "- _No IP addresses are visible when you provide the screenshot (***Please mask it before uploading***)._\n",
    "\n",
    "- _1 node cluster with a single master node (zero slave nodes) of size ```m5.xlarge``` is good enough for your spark MLlib process. These configurations might take 15 - 20 minutes to get optimal tuning parameters for the entire dataset._\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Say something went wrong and you want to spin up another EMR cluster, then make sure you terminate the previous one._\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Upon termination, stored data in your cluster will be lost. Make sure you save any data to S3 and download the notebooks to your laptop so that next time you have your jupyterHub in a different cluster, you can upload your notebook there._\n",
    "\n",
    "_***Outside of Milestone [OPTIONAL]:*** You are encouraged to practice it yourself by spinning up EMR clusters._\n",
    "\n",
    "***VERY IMPORTANT:*** With task 4, make sure you occasionally download the notebook to your local computer. Once the lab is stopped after 3 hours, your EMR cluster will be terminated, and everything will vanish."
